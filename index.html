            <p>I'm a bit of a fan of math puzzles.
There is a well-known website publishing puzzles and one of them brought me some fun for a while.</p>
<p>I'm not naming the website on purpose, but you can easily find it.
It's named after a famous mathematician who ended up almost blind.
Fortunately, he had memorized most of his books before.</p>
<p>You won't find a numeric solution here, but rather an outline of the resolution process.
Most of the equations are already on wikipedia, but without any demonstration.
I've also seen blog posts explaining how to solve the problem which were quite convoluted (axis change during revolution for instance)</p>
<p>That's what prompted me to detail my approach.
That and the need to train my math muscles: I don't have the opportunity to do much calculus at work.
Besides, I find typesetting equations in $\LaTeX$ relaxing.</p>
