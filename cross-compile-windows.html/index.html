      <h2 id="contexte">Contexte</h2>
<p>Je souhaite compiler un programme pour windows mais je n'ai pas windows. Hors de question de virtualiser et puis j'aime mon confortable make. Ce sera donc de la cross-compilation.</p>
<p>Pour ajouter au d√©lire, j'ai besoin des d√©pendances suivantes: SFML, Box2D, Boost et zlib.</p>
<p>La m√©thode d√©crite par la suite n'engage que moi, j'ai √©t√© surpris de voir que √ßa fonctionnait.</p>
<p id="zola-continue-reading"><a name="continue-reading"></a></p>
<p>Vu qu'on va compiler des librairies et pour √©viter d'en foutre partout, on va se cr√©er un dossier genre &quot;<em>crossenv</em>&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="les-bons-outils">Les bons outils</h2>
<p>La cross-compilation suppose d'utiliser un compilateur adapt√© √† la cible. Dans le cas pr√©sent il s'agit de mingw, on s'empresse donc d'installer gcc-mingw et ses √©ventuelles d√©pendances.</p>
<p>Deux syst√®mes de construction sont utilis√©s: CMake et autotools. Dans un cas comme dans un autre, il est possible de sp√©cifier la chaine de compilation que l'on souhaite utiliser (compilateur, linker, etc).</p>
<h3 id="cmake">CMake</h3>
<p>CMake permet de d√©finir une toolchain, on ne va pas se priver et on met √ßa dans <em>toolchain-mingw32.cmake</em>:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#272822;">
<span style="color:#75715e;"># the name of the target operating system
</span><span style="color:#66d9ef;">SET</span><span style="color:#f8f8f2;">(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Windows)

</span><span style="color:#75715e;"># which compilers to use for C and C++
</span><span style="color:#66d9ef;">SET</span><span style="color:#f8f8f2;">(CMAKE_C_COMPILER i686-w64-mingw32-gcc)
</span><span style="color:#66d9ef;">SET</span><span style="color:#f8f8f2;">(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER i686-w64-mingw32-g++)
</span><span style="color:#66d9ef;">SET</span><span style="color:#f8f8f2;">(CMAKE_RC_COMPILER i686-w64-mingw32-windres)

</span><span style="color:#75715e;"># here is the target environment located
</span><span style="color:#66d9ef;">SET</span><span style="color:#f8f8f2;">(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH  /usr/i686-w64-mingw32 [crossenv] )

</span><span style="color:#75715e;"># adjust the default behaviour of the FIND_XXX() commands:
# search headers and libraries in the target environment, search
# programs in the host environment
</span><span style="color:#66d9ef;">set</span><span style="color:#f8f8f2;">(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PROGRAM NEVER)
</span><span style="color:#66d9ef;">set</span><span style="color:#f8f8f2;">(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_LIBRARY ONLY)
</span><span style="color:#66d9ef;">set</span><span style="color:#f8f8f2;">(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE ONLY)
</span></pre>
<p>Je n'ai rien invent√©, √ßa vient du <a href="http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CmakeMingw">wiki cmake</a>, il faut juste adapter les noms d'√©x√©cutables.</p>
<p>C'est ensuite presque un plaisir de lancer la compilation de SFML avec √ßa:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#272822;">
<span style="color:#f8f8f2;">cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=[crossenv]/Toolchain-mingw32.cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=[crossenv] ..
</span></pre>
<p>Il est important d'installer les librairies dans le dossier &quot;<em>crossenv</em>&quot; puisqu'on pr√©cise dans la toolchain que c'est l√† qu'il faut chercher. Et en plus c'est plus hygi√©nique.</p>
<p>M√™me proc√©dure pour Box2D, j'ai juste eu √† changer un header (freeglut_internal je crois) car il ne me trouvait pas &lt;<em>Windows.h</em>&gt;: la casse lui posait probl√®me avec &lt;<em>windows.h</em>&gt; √ßa passe.
Une fois compil√©, on installe les libs Box2D et les includes √† la main dans notre crossenv. C'est moche mais √ßa fonctionne. En m√™me temps on cherche √† compiler un truc pour windows, √† ce point l√† on peu bien copier/coller en mode bourrin.</p>
<h3 id="autotools">Autotools</h3>
<p>Il nous faut √©galement zlib, qui utilise autotools. Pas de probl√®me, autotools supporte √©galement la cross-compilation.</p>
<pre style="background-color:#272822;">
<span style="color:#f8f8f2;">CC=i686-w64-mingw32-gcc AR=&quot;i686-w64-mingw32-ar s&quot; RANLIB=i686-w64-mingw32-ranlib ./configure --prefix=[crossenv]
</span><span style="color:#f8f8f2;">make
</span><span style="color:#f8f8f2;">make install
</span></pre>
<p>C'est tout. Il faut juste faire gaffe au &quot;i686-w64-mingw32-ar s&quot;, le make pleure sans l'option s.</p>
<h2 id="boost">Boost</h2>
<p>Boost est un cas √† part puisqu'utilisant un syst√®me de compilation maison: bjam. On commence par √©diter tools/build/v2/user-config.jam pour y mettre √ßa:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#272822;">
<span style="color:#f8f8f2;">using gcc : 4.8 : i686-w64-mingw32-g++ ;
</span></pre>
<p>On se fend ensuite de la proc√©dure normale:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#272822;">
<span style="color:#f8f8f2;">bootstrap.sh --with-libraries=filesystem,system --without-icu
</span><span style="color:#f8f8f2;">bjam toolset=gcc target-os=windows --prefix=[crossenv] threading=multi threadapi=win32 link=static -j 2 --layout=tagged install
</span></pre>
<p>Toutes nos d√©pendances sont compil√©es, on est content.</p>
<h2 id="compilation-finale">Compilation finale</h2>
<p>√áa aurait pu √™tre le titre d'un film mais si √ßa avait √©t√© le cas √ßa n'aurait probablement pas √©t√© int√©ressant. Parce qu'en fait √ßa se r√©sume √† √ßa:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#272822;">
<span style="color:#f8f8f2;">cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=[crossenv]/toolchain-mingw32.cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=[chez toi ou chez moi] ..
</span></pre>
<p>Il reste encore un d√©tail √† r√©gler, j'aimerais linker statiquement mon ex√©cutable (bah oui, c'est pour windows toussa...). J'ai √©t√© bourrin jusqu'au bout en for√ßant le linkage statique de la SFML et en fillant les arguments suivants √† la compilation de mon soft:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#272822;">
<span style="color:#f8f8f2;">-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=false -DCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS=-static
</span></pre><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>La cross-compilation pour windows c'est pas si terrible que √ßa. Je m'attendais √† pire. C'est pas encore tip-top (header √† bouger √† la main, linkage hasardeux) mais on arrive quand m√™me au r√©sultat attendu.
Ayant tent√© de compiler sous windows, c'est quand m√™me plus simple de cross compiler. M'enfin, les go√ªts, les couleurs...</p>
