      <p>In the <a href="https://greizgh.github.io/blog/smart-speakers-plan/">previous article</a> I ended up with a nice <em>master</em> system streaming audio with snapcast.
It's now time to assemble what will be the speakers.</p>
<p id="zola-continue-reading"><a name="continue-reading"></a></p>
<h2 id="broadcaster-improvement">Broadcaster improvement</h2>
<p>While I was still waiting for the miniamps to arrive, I've spent some time improving the broadcast system.</p>
<p>I updated snapcast and <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/94159">librespot</a> to play along nicely,
since there was an issue with the packaged librespot. I really like how easy it is to use a custom package in nixos, and how easy it is to contribute back to nixpkgs with an update PR.</p>
<p>Then exposed snapcast server on avahi, which is as easy as:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#272822;">
<span style="color:#f8f8f2;">  </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#fd971f;">services</span><span style="color:#f92672;">.</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#fd971f;">avahi </span><span style="background-color:#f92672;color:#f8f8f0;">=</span><span style="color:#f8f8f2;"> {
    </span><span style="color:#a6e22e;">enable </span><span style="color:#f92672;">= </span><span style="color:#ae81ff;">true</span><span style="color:#f8f8f2;">;
    </span><span style="color:#a6e22e;">publish</span><span style="color:#f8f8f2;">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e;">enable </span><span style="color:#f92672;">= </span><span style="color:#ae81ff;">true</span><span style="color:#f8f8f2;">;
    </span><span style="color:#a6e22e;">publish</span><span style="color:#f8f8f2;">.</span><span style="color:#a6e22e;">userServices </span><span style="color:#f92672;">= </span><span style="color:#ae81ff;">true</span><span style="color:#f8f8f2;">;
  }</span><span style="background-color:#f92672;color:#f8f8f0;">;</span><span style="color:#f8f8f2;">
</span></pre>
<p>Not directly related to the broadcaster, I also set up a NTP server on my local network.
This is an attempt to reduce timedrifting between all speakers.
It might not be necessary, but won't add any cost or maintenance burden.</p>
<h2 id="change-of-plan">Change of plan</h2>
<p>It wouldn't have been fun if everything went according to initial plan.</p>
<p>One thing that I changed was the way to build the system for each speaker.
I initially planned to build a NixOS image like for the broadcaster.
However, since pi0s are ARMv6 targets, it means I cannot leverage a binary cache.
In other terms, that means I would have to rebuild every single package from scratch.
In a qemu VM...</p>
<p>I gave it a go: set up my host to emulate armv6, create a bare configuration and use nixos-generators.
That was not a success: it was painfully slow and got stuck at some point.</p>
<p>As much as I love nix for system management, it's clearly not the right tool for now for embedded targets.
(It still has a huge potential in this domain though)</p>
<p>I didn't want to download a raspbian image and manually configure the system.
That would have been the easy way, but I wanted a more <em>scalable</em> process.</p>
<h2 id="embedded-system-builders">Embedded system builders</h2>
<p>There are two major contenders when it comes to building tailor made linux systems: <a href="https://www.yoctoproject.org/">yocto</a> and <a href="https://buildroot.org/">buildroot</a>.
These tools will still require to compile everything, but at least they offer cache and cross-compilation, so that should speed things up.</p>
<p>Yocto was more appealing because of its clean separation of layers.
However I faced a segmentation fault of the cross-compiled <code>m4</code> utility.
After some digging in forums, it seems <a href="https://discourse.nixos.org/t/build-a-yocto-rootfs-inside-nix/2643">I'm not the only one facing issues</a>.
At that point I had received the miniamps, so everything was ready to play music except for the software part.
That was a strong motivation to stick to the objective: generating a linux system and not fixing obscure compilation errors.</p>
<p>Time to try buildroot.
Setup is pretty easy: clone, configure and build.
Buildroot assumes few installed dependencies but nothing too fancy, a short <a href="./shell.nix"><code>shell.nix</code></a> file with a FHSUserEnv will do the trick.</p>
<p>Although one can keep a device definition properly separated from buildroot sources, I more than once had to clean everything because of missing packages.
There is no proper way to extend the <code>post-image.sh</code> script, so I spent a fair amount of time to understand it was the cause of missing configuration in <code>config.txt</code>.</p>
<p>Once the specifics from buildroot understood, it's basically a matter of configuring and building individual software:</p>
<ul>
<li>wpa_supplicant to automatically connect to wireless network;</li>
<li>ntpd to keep time under control;</li>
<li>config.txt to <a href="https://www.hifiberry.com/docs/software/configuring-linux-3-18-x/">add hifyberry to the device tree overlay</a>;</li>
<li>avahi daemon to help find the broadcaster;</li>
<li>snapclient to stream music;</li>
</ul>
<p>The build process will output a flashable <code>sdcard.img</code> üéâ</p>
<p>The full config can be found <a href="https://gitlab.com/greizgh/rspeaker-system">in this repository</a>.</p>
<h2 id="pimp-my-speakers">Pimp my speakers</h2>
<p>I previously mentioned reflective vinyl and green fabric, it turns out we wanted more <em>glitter</em>!
Our local DIY store had some fancy adhesive coating, spot on!</p>

<h2 id="custom-parts">Custom parts</h2>
<p>This project involved some 3D printed parts such as the &quot;plugs&quot; to fill the holes previously used to fix the frame holding the fabric.</p>
<p>But the main design work was to create a proper enclosure for the raspberry + miniamp.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So far we've been pretty happy with these two speakers.</p>
<p>The goal has been reached:</p>
<ul>
<li>we have easily relocatable speakers;</li>
<li>streaming from mpd or spotify is a breeze;</li>
<li>speaker system is easily reproduced with buildroot;</li>
</ul>
<p>So what's next?</p>
<ul>
<li>maybe experiment with bluetooth streaming as a source</li>
<li>ditch the venerable hifi system and convert its speakers to wireless ones</li>
</ul>
